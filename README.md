There's currently not an "App Store" for servers. I don't want to deal with the overhead or responsibility of making one so I'll leave that up to the people but I feel like with a standard format (for now it's json or yaml but I'll be incorporating docker-compose soon) I can enable people to easily create their own and provide a good vehicle/interface to manage them. This is that vehicle.

This is a Template (or a distributed app store depending on how you look at it) which was initially built for portainer but after seeing the potential something that actually supported a good templating format has to change how people use servers I've built it out for multiple platforms (most importantly Yacht) although I haven't had time to keep up with the requests from people.
